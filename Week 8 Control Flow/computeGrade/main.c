/*
Write a C program that prints the ID and grade of each student in a class. The
input contains the student IDs and their marks. The range of the marks is from 0 to 100. The
relationships of the marks and grades are given below:
Grade Mark
A 100-75
B 74-65
C 64-55
D 54-45
F 44-0
Use the sentinel value –1 for student ID to indicate the end of user input.
Sample input and output sessions are given below:
(1) Test Case 1:
Enter Student ID:
11
Enter Mark:
56
Grade = C
Enter Student ID:
21
Enter Mark:
89
Grade = A
Enter Student ID:
31
Enter Mark:
34
Grade = F
Enter Student ID:
-1
(2) Test Case 2:
Enter Student ID:
-1
