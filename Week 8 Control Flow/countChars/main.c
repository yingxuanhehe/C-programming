/*
Write a C program that reads in character by character from an input source, until
‘#’ is entered. The output of the program is the number of English letters and the number of digits
that appear in the input.
Some sample input and output sessions are given below:
(1) Test Case 1:
Enter your characters (# to end):
happy 34567 fans#
The number of digits: 5
The number of letters: 9
(2) Test Case 2:
Enter your characters (# to end):
1a2b3c#
The number of digits: 3
The number of letters: 3

{
    int ccount = 0, dcount = 0;
    char ch;
    printf("Enter your characters (# to end): \n");

    do
    {
        scanf("%c", &ch);
        if( ('a'<=ch && ch<='z') || ('A'<=ch && ch<='Z') )
