/*
The salary scheme for a company is given as follows:
Salary range for grade A: $700 - $899
Salary range for grade B: $600 - $799
Salary range for grade C: $500 - $649

In addition, a person whose salary is between $600 and $649 is in grade C if his merit points are
below 10, otherwise he is in grade B. A person whose salary is between $700 and $799 is in grade
B if his merit points are below 20, otherwise he is in grade A. Write a program to read in a
person's salary and his merit points, and displays his grade.
Sample input and output sessions are given below:
(1) Test Case 1:
Enter the salary:
700
Enter the merit:
20
The grade: A
(2) Test Case 2:
Enter the salary:
500
Enter the merit:
20
The grade: C
